# SPLR-FEVER
This repository contains the Feature EvolutioN ExtractoR, part of our work on Software Product Line Research.

_We are currently working on getting all the information in here, this is a work in progress right now_

In this repository you can find 
- the code of the FEVER tool, use to extract information from Git commits in a feature-oriented way
- spreadsheets containing the results of the evaluation of the tool
- spreadsheets regarding the identification of co-evolution patterns
- general documentation about what the tool does, where it comes from, what's this all about

Word of caution: 

The tool itself relies on quite a few other academical tools, such as part of KconfigReader, and CPPSTATS.
As of today, the "code" is not integrated, but the tools are called one after the other 
through command line - invoked through Java code. 
This makes the implementation extremely sensible to the environment in which it is run. 

The installation process is described in another file, but it is complicated for sure. 
We are currently working on providing a virtual machine with everything setup, so you don't have to worry about those things.
There is no point in you, dear user, going through all the hassle we already went through :)
